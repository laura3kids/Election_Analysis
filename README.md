### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
    
## Results
    
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
    Greatest success in meeting your financial goals for a theater kickstarter appears to be in May
    November and December appear to be the worst months to launch a successful kickstarter campaign
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
    The higher your financial goal, the least likely it is that your project will be successful
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
    Unable to show if the successful kickstarters made any money.    
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
    By using average length of pledge drive time is related to outcomes - If there were a longer the pledge drive time frame, were there more successful outcomes? 
    Were the trends we identified with theater/play the same for all the other categories? 
    Were these trends for outcomes stronger in certain countries than others?
